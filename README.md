# ABOUT

Responsive Models Workshop from May 3 to May 16, 2017, at the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde School of Design and Arts, Manila, Philippines, in which faculty members where taught by Orion Campos, during a two weeks workshop, the basics on electronics and digital fabrication to create a responsive object.

At the first week, daily classes of Arduino, Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper 3D, Firefly, and digital fabrication took place. Organized by themes and teaching from the very beginning electronic concepts, the classes created a base for the participants to develop their own projects during the second week. At this second phase, the participants were divided into groups of 3 to 4 individuals, and assisted daily by the main tutor, each group developed a responsive working object from their own concept using primarily tools and softwares taught at the first week. The final working prototype was presented after 12 days of classes, made from people who mostly, have none or few experience at electronics or digital fabrication processes.

### 1_blink
Blink
Turns on an LED on and off repeatedly.
It is possible to use the on-board LED. Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to digital pin 13.
If desired, a 5mm LED can be used on digital pin 13. If so, it is not necessary to use a resistor, since the pin 13 allready has a resistor attached.
Output:
1x 5mm LED
1x 220O resistor (if the digital pin 13 is not used)

# PROJECTS

### Group1

**Random Drawing Machine**

Create drawings by the use of a Sharpie pen, attached to the end of two lasercut acrylic arms, attached to two parallel circles, connected to two 12V DC Motors.

The speed of those two motors are related to the values read by two Infrared Distance Sensor (IRDS), turning the DC Motor faster if the distance sensor reads a higher value (closer object). Since the sensors are attached distant from each other, the values that one sensor reads is different from the other, moving the DC Motors at an erratic and unexpected time and speed, creating a random drawing from the attached Sharpie pen.

Display the read values and the remapped speed values on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.

### Group2

**Automatic Watering Plant System**

Create an automatic watering plant system that will run a small 3V DC water pump to water a plant into a vase if the Soil Moisture Sensor into the vase reads a value higher than the optimal value of moisture for that plant, meaning that the soil is dry.
If the moisture level reads by the sensor is higher than the optimal value of moisture for the plant, a red LED will turn on, and a message "Dry Soil :(" will appear on the LCD Screen, together with the water pump being turned on, if not, a green LED will turn on and a message "Happy Plant :)" will appear on the LCD Screen.

The water compartment also has a Water Level Sensor with three different sizes of pins, which read three different values. If the sensor reads that the three pins are in contact with water a green LED will turn on, and a message "Waterlevel: Full" will appear on the LCD Screen. If the sensor reads that two pins are in contact with water, a yellow LED will turn on, and a message "WaterLevel: Half" will appear on the LCD Screen. If the sensor reads that only one pin is in contact with water, a red LED will turn on, and a message "WaterLevel: Empty" will appear on the LCD Screen.
Also a condition was created that if the Soil Moisture Sensor reads a value higher than the optimal value of moisture for the plant, AND the Water Level Sensor reads that only one pin is in contact with water, the pump will not be turned on.

Display the read values and the desirable information on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.

### Group3

**Animatronic Owl**

Create an animatronic owl, which will follow the user turning its head to the right or to the left side, by a servo motor, based o values read from two PIR sensors attached to opposite sides of the owl and pointed to different directions. If the PIR sensor reads a higher value (detects movement), the owl will turn its head to this specific direction (left or right). If none of the two PIR sensors detects movement, the owl will turn its head into a central position.
The wings of the owl are attached each to one metal gear servo. They will turn up based on the values of one IFDS, meaning if the user is closer to the object, the wings move higher.

An additional behaviour was added to the head, which hosts a photoresistor sensor. Two LEDs will be in the place of the eyes. They will be constantly turned on, until the photoresistor reads a very low value, meaning that someone is blocking the light with its hand (petting the owl), at this moment the LEDs will start to blink repeatedly.

Display the read values and the desirable information on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
